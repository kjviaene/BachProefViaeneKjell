\label{ch:methodologie}

To test the possible methods described earlier a virtual network was set up using Oracle VirtualBox \footnote{ https://www.virtualbox.org/} in combination with Vagrant \footnote{https://www.vagrantup.com/} and Ansible \footnote{https://www.ansible.com/}. The specifics of this test environment can be found in the next chapter. A physical network was not possible as this required to much materials and cost. The school is located to far as well to be able to build an environment there. Which resulted in the need of a virtual network. The only issue with the virtual network is the fact that only a computer with eight gigabytes of RAM is available, which sometimes is not that much when running four to five virtual machines.\\

For each method adjustments are made to the test environment. These adjustments already form a base to the conclusion made in the thesis as the difficulty of configuring the devices is a factor for evaluation. When the configurations have been completed it is tested if the wanted results have been reached. If this is the case, or if not, than a conclusion is made about the effectiveness of the method. In the final conclusion a bigger conclusion about all methods will be made based on these setups. Some loopholes and such that might have been encountered during the setups of these environments will be mentioned there as well.\\
