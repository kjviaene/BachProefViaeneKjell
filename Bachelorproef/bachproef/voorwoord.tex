This bachelor thesis was written as part of the course which shares the same name. This thesis together with the internship I'm currently doing are the final two courses to complete a bachelor diploma in Applied Informatics.
\section*{Choosing the subject}
The subject of the thesis is one I picked from a list of suggestions that were posted online on the school platform \textit{Chamillo}. The subject caught my eye because of my personal experience with the issue. There would be times were we would take digital examinations for certain courses and people all around me were cheating to get great results. I always found it rather disrespectful and disturbing that people were doing this and that they were able to this so easily. This is a real demotivation for students who actually study for the examinations. Because when you get the results and realize that everybody who cheats got better results than you, then why bother if no penalties are given out anyway.\\
This of course devalues the examination itself and the course as a whole. Resulting in people not taking courses with digital exams seriously and getting high grades without ever understanding what the course matter was really about.\\
So when the opportunity was there for me to possibly change this and help the school with solving the problem, I eagerly picked this as my subject for my bachelor thesis.
