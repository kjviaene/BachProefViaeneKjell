\section{Vyos Router / ACL's}
\subsection{Introduction}
As mentioned in the State of the Arts chapter, Vyos does not implement Access control lists like cisco devices do. Instead there is a build in firewall application. We use this to mimic the ACL's that one would configure on a cisco device. Our goal is to block all external sites except the ones that may be accessed during the exam (in our examples we'll just be using the standard school website). Furthermore, the vyos router is implemented only as a router. No DHCP/firewall settings were configured outside of the scope of this thesis. But if this would be the case, these settings would not interfere with our configuration. As long as the correct rules are followed of course. 
\subsection{Installation of Vyos}
The installation of Vyos is nothing really special. To start off you'll need the image. You can pick one that meets your needs. In the case of this thesis the setup was automated however. Which was done by using vagrant and a Vyos box \textit{bertvv/vyos116} [SOURCE VYOS]. This however is pretty much the same as manually downloading the .iso file, making a bootable device with it, and installing it onto your device of choice. After the installation of Vyos it is advised  to reboot the machine. It should be quite obvious that the machine that you wish to use should have 2 working network cards installed. One as an inside interface and one as an outside interface card. More than two can of course be used (for a DMZ zone for instance) but it is not required and not touched upon here.
\subsection{Configuration of the router}
All of the configurations for the router are placed in a shell script. This script is ran by vagrant when the machine is provisioned. Remember that all these settings can be done manually just as easily, explanations here about commands are given from a general point of view. Nothing changes if one chooses to automate the process or do it manually. The first things that are configured are the interfaces and basic information about the router.\\

\begin{cisco}[title=Basic configuration]
configure
#
# Basic settings
#
set system host-name 'Router'
set system domain-name example.lan
#
# IP settings
#
set interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp
set interfaces ethernet eth0 description WAN
set interfaces ethernet eth1 address 172.16.255.254/16
set interfaces ethernet eth1 description inside
\end{cisco} \\
The first command puts us in the configuration mode, if this command is forgotten, all the following commands will fail and the router will be left unconfigured. Next up the host-name and the domain name are configured. Followed by the configuration of the interfaces. There are two interfaces configured, both Ethernet ports. \textit{Eth0} is the port which leads to the outside and \textit{eth1} is our inside port which is connected to our local network \textit{example.lan}. Our inside interface is configured as the default gateway for all the devices in our network and has been given the IP-Address \textit{172.16.255.254} as is common practice.The outside interface gets it IP from our ISP.\\
The following commands configure the Network Address Translation (NAT) for our interfaces. In most networks this will be a lot more complicated but for us the only thing that is happening is our inside network addresses that get masqueraded when exiting via the outside interface.
\begin{cisco}[title=NAT configuration]
set nat source rule 100 outbound-interface eth0
set nat source rule 100 source address '172.16.0.0/16'
set nat source rule 100 translation address masquerade
#
# Domain Name Service
#
set system name-server 10.0.2.3
set service dns forwarding system
set service dns forwarding domain example.lan server 172.16.0.10
set service dns forwarding listen-on 'eth1'
\end{cisco}\\
After the NAT configuration, the DNS settings are configured, which are quite important to us. The system name-server command sets the main server that is chosen when DNS queries are received. In this case \textit{10.0.2.3} is the address that has to be configured when using virtual box. In a physical network however, this can be set to any other DNS server that you know of, that is outside of your network. Following the system name-server we enable dns forwarding and all the queries which concern a device inside the `` example.lan`` network are forwarded to our local server. This server has been given the \textit{172.16.0.10} IP-Address.\\
When looking at this configuration you might think that there is an other configuration here that suits your situation better. You can for instance change the system name-server to your local DNS server, so that all your requests get send to your local DNS server. Then you could configure your local DNS to forward all requests to an outside DNS. But as it's very likely that the DNS server will just send those requests back to the router for him to route them to the outside, we skip a step by just immediately making the router doing it this way. There is however an opportunity here that you might have noticed. If we indeed set our sytem name-server as our local dns server we can choose which domains get forwarded to other servers. In this case we would not allow our local server to forward any requests and we would effectively filter our packets.
\begin{cisco}[title=Filtering using DNS forwarding]
#set system name-server 172.16.0.10
#set service dns forwarding system
#set service dns forwarding domain hogent.be server 10.0.2.3
#set service dns forwarding listen-on 'eth1'
\end{cisco}\\
When using this configuration we actually blocked all other websites except the ones of the `` hogent.be `` domain. This achieves the same as we will achieve with our ACL's and looks a lot simpler. But it is not as simple to transfer this to a Cisco device. And because we are not actually using Vyos in our real life situation, we will take a look at our firewall configuration next.\\
The firewall configuration is split up into two main parts. Configuring our groups and configuring our rules. The configuration of the groups is in itself divided into two parts as well. The fist part being the configuration of our network group:\\
\begin{cisco}[title=network group configuration]
set firewall group network-group INSIDE-NET network 172.16.0.0/16
\end{cisco}
Here the group ``INSIDE-NET`` is created. This group simply contains the inside network address range. This group holds the group of addresses of all the devices that you want to be targeted. So if there are 5 networks that need to follow certain rules, all five would be added to this group, each with its own IP-Range.\\
The next groups to be configured are the address groups and the port groups:\\
\begin{cisco}[title= address and port groups configuration]
set firewall group address-group SCHOOL-NET address 178.62.144.90
set firewall group address-group SCHOOL-NET address 193.190.173.131
# 
set firewall group port-group TCP-ACCESS port 80
set firewall group port-group TCP-ACCESS port 443
\end{cisco}
The address-group `` SCHOOL-NET`` contains the IP addresses of the websites that we want to allow access to. You can add as much addresses as you want to this group, as long as they are allowed. This group could be compared with a whitelist. One could also make a group in the same way but use it as a blacklist. This by adding all known addresses that need to be blocked and just add them to an other group which will be implemented in an other way.\\
The port-group `` TCP-ACCESS`` contains our TCP ports that we want to block all traffic to. Here ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) were chosen to block all packets that wish to connect with a web server. Each group can be given a description as well, this by simply replacing the `` port ``, `` address `` and `` network `` keywords with the keyword `` description ``.  And following that with a description of choice (encapsulated by ` marks ). Once all the necessary groups are configured, the only thing left to do is implement these groups in the correct way. And defining the rules surrounding them.\\
\begin{cisco}[title= Configuring the firewall rules]
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL description 'Blocking unwanted sites'
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL default-action drop
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 200 description `Deny any HTTP and HTTPS packets`
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 200 action drop
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 200 destination group port-group TCP-ACCESS
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 200 source group network-group INSIDE-NET
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 200 state established enable
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 200 state related enable
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 100 description `Allow access to school websites`
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 100 action accept
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 100 destination group address-group SCHOOL-NET
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 100 state established enable
set firewall name ACCESS-CONTROL rule 100 state related enable
\end{cisco}
The following things are happening here:
\begin{itemize}
\item A description is given to our rule-set. When working with bigger networks this is a must. Otherwise one might drown in all the different configured rule-sets on each interface.
\item The default action for the rule-set is set to drop. This means that all packages that do not match a single statement will be dropped. Other choices here are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reject: Drops and notifies the source if no rules were matched.
\item Accept: Allows the packages that did not match a single rule to pass.
\end{itemize}
\item The declaration of a rule. Which consists out of multiple lines:
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of the rule. The lowest number will be checked first. So if an ``allow all`` rule would be inserted at number 1, no other rule would aver be checked and all traffic would pass. The opposite (adding a `` deny all `` rule) is also true, then no traffic would get through.
\item The description of a rule. Which once again is quite important in bigger networks.
\item The action of the rule. This can be: drop,reject, accept or inspect. The inspect option is a function that is not used anymore. The other ones are the same as mentioned above.
\item The destination of the packets. In this example the destination of rule 200 is the port group ``TCP-ACCESS``, so all packets that have TCP 80/443 port as destination will match this rule. In rule 100 the address-group ``SCHOOL-NET`` is used. All the packets with one of the IP's that are in that group as destination IP will match this rule. Instead of using groups, it is also possible to assign addresses or ports directly. If for instance only one address may match it is easier to not define a group and just assign the one address here.
\item The source of the packets. The same explanation as for the destination of the packets works here, except of course that the destination is replaced by the source of the packets. In this example the packets need to originate from the local network which is defined by the ``INSIDE-NET`` group.
\item The state established and related lines are for stateful packet filtering. This checks whether a certain package is connected to previously established TCP connections, if this is true, they are allowed through. Or if a new connection is started but the connection is related to an already existing connection.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Once all these configurations have been made, the only thing left to do is set this rule-set to a certain interface:
\begin{cisco}[title=Assigning the rule-set]
set interfaces ethernet eth0 firewall out name ACCESS-CONTROL
\end{cisco}
Here the interface is specified on which the packets should be checked. As we want to control users from inside our network who are requesting data from outside the network, the most logical choice is to put the rule-set on our outside interface checking the data going OUT. And that is exactly what this line does.
\subsection{Translation to Cisco devices}
To apply this on cisco devices, all one needs to do is define ACL's with the same information as contained in all the groups here. 
\begin{cisco}
access-list 111 permit tcp host 178.62.144.90 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 eq www
access-list 111 permit tcp host 178.62.144.90 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 eq 443
access-list 111 permit tcp host 178.62.144.90 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 eq ftp
interface eth0
ip access-group 110 out
\end{cisco}
This little piece of code allows HTTP requests to pass through the eth0 interface when going out and when they are destined for the website at \textit{178.62.144.90}.  It also allows packets with destination set for port 443(HTTPS) and the ftp protocol. All the rules that we applied in our Vyos router are easily translated to ACL's on a cisco device. It just requires a lot of typing.
\subsection{Effectiveness/conclusion}
So what is the result of these settings? When now connecting to the network the user is able to connect to the domain that we specified (hogent.be) but gets an error whenever trying to connect to any other website. So the goal that was set has been reached. Directly surfing to the IP of the website does not resolve anything as the router does not care how the user connects to a website, it blocks it either way. There are of course ways to circumvent this system (like using a VPN) but the easiest ways of cheating have been prevented. Although nothing has been done against files locally on the computer. It is worth mentioning as well that everything within the own network is still available. Possible file servers can still be reached and function as needed.
\section{Dns Whitelisting}
\subsection{Installing DnsMasq}
To use this method the installation of dnsmasq is required. Dnsmasq is an easy way of configuring a DNS and DHCP server. The DHCP functions are of no importance here and will not be implemented or installed. These are disabled by default upon the installation of dnsmasq. When working in larger networks it is advised to not just use dnsmasq but combine it with an other service like BIND. Dnsmasq is supported on Linux, Android,BSD and Mac OS X platforms. The installation of dnsmasq itself is pretty straightforward. You execute the ``apt-get update`` command followed by ``àpt-get install dnsmasq`` or use ``yum`` on non Debian systems. Restarting the service after installation or configuration is always a good idea. This can be achieved by issuing the ``sudo service dnsmasq force-reload`` command. Once installed be sure to check your firewall and SELinux settings. These might block traffic that is needed for our DNS service to work. If this is the case, adjust those appropriately. \\
If automation of the installation is required, there are plenty of Dnsmasq roles available for Ansible. Most of these do easily allow the configuration that is required in this setup and for that reason in this example all the configurations were made manually.
\subsection{Configuring Dnsmasq}
The first configuration that was made was actually to the router. It is important for this method to work to make sure that the router in the network does not forward requests on its own. The router was configured to only use the local DNS server. It was also configured that no ACL was blocking DNS requests, as the local DNS server will still send requests out for those domains that are allowed.\\
The first and most important file that is configured is the \textit{``/etc/dnsmasq.conf``} file. This file already contains a lot of lines, those will be left out here and only the lines that are of importance to our situation are shown. The content of ``dnsmasq.conf`` is the following:
\begin{cisco}[title=dnsmasq.conf file]
domain=example.lan
dhcp-option=option:router,172.16.255.254
interface=enp0s8
listen-address=172.16.0.10

domain-needed
no-resolv
log-queries
expand-hosts

server=/hogent.be/10.0.2.3
server=/serverfault.com/10.0.2.3

address=/#/127.0.0.1

conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d
\end{cisco}
Every line has its own purpose:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first line sets the domain name in which our server is located. This is not necessary and is mostly a feature that is used if you configure DHCP settings as well. But it is also required when the option ``expand-hosts`` is set. Which will be touched upon later.
\item Dhcp-option allows for a lot of configuration. The only one used here is the option which overrides the default router that dnsmasq has configured. By default this is the IP-Address of the same machine that is running dnsmasq. In our case this is not correct so it was adjusted to fit our network. If the router is actually the same machine, then of course no configuration is required here.
\item The interface configuration sets the interface on which the DNS server should listen for requests. This should be pretty easy to figure out. Generally speaking you do not want the server to listen on any WAN ports. If there is a situation in which the server has a lot of interfaces and it is easier to mention those interfaces on which you do not want the server to listen, you can make use of the ``except-interface=`` option.
\item The listen-address option does the same as the interface option. Only here the interface is defined by the IP-Addressed assigned to it. So only use this when the IP is static.
\item ``domain-needed`` ensures that every requests is a full name. No requests of simple names will be resolved (for instance google instead of google.com)
\item ``no-resolv`` is the most important configuration to make when using this method. It ensures us that dnsmasq will not look at ``/etc/resolv.conf`` to resolve requests. It will only look at the servers specified later in the dnsmasq.conf file. More clarification on these follows. So basically it disables DNS forwarding
\item ``log-queries`` is just useful to have enabled. It logs all queries in `` /var/log/daemon.log`` which makes it easier to debug when necessary.
\item ``expand-hosts``  is an other useful option to have enabled. It automatically adds the domain set in the domain option to all simple names that are added in the hosts-file.
\item The next portion of the file binds certain domains to certain name servers. In our case this is literally our whitelist. Every site here (hogent.be,serverfault.com) will be resolved using the server mentioned behind it. Which in this case is \textit{10.0.2.3}, the default DNS IP-Address forvirtualbox. By doing this, the specified domains will not get translated by the local hosts file but the request will be forwarded. Which is exactly what we want.
\item The next to last option ``address=/\#/127.0.0.1`` makes it so that all other requests (\#) are directed to the local server. Which means that connections to all domains which are not actually located at \textit{127.0.0.1} will fail. Which was our goal.
\item Finally the option ``conf-dir=`` allows to set an other configuration file that should be looked at. This can be usefull if you want to be able to quickly switch between a blocked network and a not blocked network. You could for instance make a general configuration file which has the general settings (domain,interface,...) and then point to an other conf file. The other config file would be a file with all the options which restrict access to the internet. While a third config file could be made where all settings are set so internet access works as normal. This enables you to adjust limitations by just changing one line in one file. Instead of having the chance/commenting all the settings each time you want to switch. (In this example it just points to an empty directory)
\end{itemize}
After setting these options websites will not work anymore, except if they are listed with their own name server. To be able to still translate local addresses you'll need to add those to the hosts file which is located at ``/etc/hosts``. This should look along the lines of this:
\begin{cisco}[title=/etc/hosts file]
172.16.0.10 dns.example.lan
172.16.0.11 samba.example.lan
172.16.0.12 dhcp.example.lan
172.16.0.13 web.example.lan
\end{cisco}
If this is done right, the users will still be able to reach all the necessary server (file server for instance) while still being blocked from unauthorized websites.
\subsection{Effectiveness/conclusion}
It is harder for students to reach certain websites. But while testing this it is possible to reach certain websites when the IP-Address is known and they are added to the local hosts file of the students personal device. However surprisingly a lot of websites do not allow acces via IP and actually require you to use a DNS server. So while it is probably the easiest method of all the ones seen here to get around, it's still not child's play.
\section{Firewall PFSense}
\subsection{Setting up the firewall}
As mentioned multiple times, the firewall is a PFSense firewall which is based on FreeBSD and is free open source software. It functions not only as a firewall, but as a router as well. In the setup used the firewall replaces our Vyos router because this is was considerably easier to deploy. The firewall has 2 interfaces (which is the minimum required), one WAN interface which gets its IP dynamically from a DHCP server. The second interface is a LAN interface which gets the IP \textit{172.16.255.254} in the network. It functions as the default gateway for all connected devices. When deploying a PFSense machine, these are the only things required before the setup is completed, the assigning of the interfaces. If there are VLANS, they need to be configured as well. But they can always be added later on. The interfaces can of course be adjusted as well. When these are all configured, access to the physical device is no longer needed and continuation on the web interface is advised. To connect with the interface, one just simply goes to the IP of the LAN interface from within the network. SSH access is not enabled by default. This can be enabled from the console though if this is required. The exact details of how the configuration is done will not be explained as this all depends on what way of configuration is chosen. When using the web interface everything is quite straight forward and obvious. When using the console, it is assumed that you have enough knowledge to have an idea of the correct commands.\\
When PFSense is installed and the interfaces are configured, some basic configurations are of course needed. These configurations will heavily depend on the environment in which the firewall is deployed however. But in General following settings should be configured:
\begin{itemize}
\item The domain in which the firewall functions.
\item Adding a personal administration user. When PFSense is deployed, a standard admin account will be created. But it should be obvious that it's a bad idea to just leave this as is. 
\item Configure the DNS that you wish to use as primary DNS and as Secondary. 
\item Configure the DNS forwarder/resolver settings to your own liking. An option exists to disable or enable the ability for the firewall to act as a DNS request resolver. This allows you to specify certain domains yourself. In this case that function was disabled. The DNS servers that were configured were the Virtual Box standard server (\textit{10.0.2.3}) and the local DNS server \textit{172.16.0.10}.
\item Remove the rules that allow all traffic. Leave the rule that makes sure that you can not lock yourself out of the web interface.
\item Depending on the situation a lot more settings can be set. But these are the most critical ones that should be set before starting anything else.
\end{itemize} 

Once these settings have been configured the firewall is ready for further configuration.
\subsection{Configuring the firewall}
There are a lot of different ways that this firewall can be of use to us. The two main ways being using rules (comparable with ACL's) and adding our personal DNS records (comparable with DNS whitelisting). Here the first option was chosen as it seemed more logical and easier to enable and disable. Which also is something that should be taken into consideration.
The different steps to take are very similar to what was done when configuring the Vyos router. First off aliases are configured to add the domains to that we want to allow through our firewall. These are shown in the following image:
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Pfsense_Alias.png}

The aliases used here are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lan\textunderscore Zone: The local servers, these are not used in any rules here but just serve as an example.
\item Whitelist: This list contains certain sites that we want to reach. On this list the option ``Type`` was set to Host(s). This requires you to fill in an IP-Address or a Fully qualified domain name. In this list are some websites that we want to reach.
\item Whitelist\textunderscore two: This list has the same purpose as the list above it but here the option was set to Network(s). This requires you to fill in addresses in CIDR format. But if you set the subnet mask to /32 you of course can still specify a single IP address. Both these options were chosen just to show that both work. Again in this list are some websites that we want to access.
\end{itemize}
When adding a list a name has to be chosen. This name should be a logical one as this has be used as a reference. Further the other settings are straight-forward and to your own choosing.
There is also a possibility to add port and url groups. But as the IP setting fulfills our needs we won't use these. But as the name suggests these are used to make aliases for groups of ports and urls. (As you may have noticed this is very similiar to the groups configured on a Vyos router).
When all the desired aliases have been set the next step should be configuring the rules. The rules that were set in this example are:

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Pfsense_Rules.png}
\begin{itemize}
\item The first rule is added automatically by PfSense to prevent you from locking yourself out.
\item The second rule allow traffic to DNS servers. As we are not blocking DNS access but rather blocking website access this is important to have. Otherwise no site would work, whitelisted or not.
\item The third rule allows HTTP (port 80) TCP/UDP traffic for the hosts listed on the Whitelist list.  The next line allows HTTPS traffic for the same list of hosts. These combined makes it possible for most sites to load. Although some exceptions might not have enough with these two ports. And then further investigation into which ports are required and those should be added.
\item The last rules allows all IPv4 traffic to the networks specified in the Whitelist\textunderscore two list. 
\end{itemize}
After this is done, all necessary configurations are made. Everything that is not mentioned in any rule will be dropped. So only access to the sites/domains on our lists are allowed now. Do remember if you are working local resources to allow these in the rules as well (not mentioned in this screenshot). Otherwise you won't be able to communicate with local servers. This configuration is very quickly done and should have the same effect as router ACL's. But remember the mention of the possibility to have the same functionalities as our DNS whitelist. This can be achieved by using the DNS resolver/forwarder option. If these are enabled one could simply block all DNS traffic going out and add the wanted addresses to the Host/Domain overrides at the bottom of the configuration page. Once this is done the web pages will be accessible again. Do not forget to enable the HTTP/HTTPS traffic though.
\subsection{Effectiveness/conclusion}
Not much new can be said here for the Effectiveness as it does the exact same as our Router ACL or DNS whitelist. Except that it is combined into one webinterface. And that is the big obvious pro here. The fact that it is very easy to use. Except for the configuration of the interfaces, no console is required. Everything can be configured with a user interface and a modern and easy of use one. But maybe for some, this might be a downer as it allows inexperienced users to do more damage if they would get it.
The only other problem that I noticed while using PFSense is the fact that apparently PFSense (and the Edge browser as well) will sometimes remember certain translations or other data which enables a user to visit sites that were visited when certain rules were not enabled yet. This can be prevented when certain options are disabled though, most of these can be found under the advanced tab. A general problem with the previous three tested methods is the fact that it's not always easy to find out what ip/protocol/domain to allow to be able to reach certain websites. The ``netacad.com`` domain for example would not load while everything was allowed, while other sites on the same list were loading perfectly. It is assumed that this has to do with certain redirection and the site being hosted on addresses that are not the ones that a simple tracert of nslookup will give you.
